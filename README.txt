My First project : Landing Page 

my code in this repository is meant to satisfy the project # 1 rubric of the Front Ent Web Developer nanodegree.

Landing page is the conversion of a static page to a page that allows some sort of interaction. The dynamicity is achieved through javascript.

Starter code taken from udacity help material which is founded in(https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

******  I achieved all requirements which are demanded from my which is:

1- linking your app.js. where should this file go based on your present knowledge? We’ll test some other locations later.

2- Build out your HTML and at least 3 content sections. The rest of your functionality relies on these sections.

3- Build the navigation menu. This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page.

4- Add functionality to distinguish the section in view. While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.

5- Add the functionality to scroll to sections. Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page

****   then I test the functionality of all I do and it's working well.

****   additional parts also done :

1- Add additional sections to your HTML document. See how the navigation builds.

2- Test the performance. The performance of your page can be affected by how you write your javascript as well as where you load your javascript.

3- Add a scroll to top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.

and that is all .

thanks .
